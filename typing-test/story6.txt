A Crow sat on a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak. A clever Fox saw her and wanted that cheese. He praised her saying, "You are so beautiful! Your voice must be lovely too." The Crow felt proud and wanted to show off. She opened her beak to sing, and the cheese fell down. The Fox quickly grabbed it and walked away laughing. The Crow felt foolish. Sweet words are not always honest. Sometimes, they are just tricks.
