A hungry Wolf wanted to eat sheep but could not get close because of the shepherd. One day, he found a sheep skin and wore it to trick everyone. He walked among the flock and looked just like a real sheep. At night, he ate one sheep and planned to do more. But soon, the shepherd found out and punished him. The Wolf plan failed because lying and tricking others brings danger in the end. Being dishonest may work once but never lasts long.
