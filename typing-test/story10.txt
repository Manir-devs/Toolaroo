A young Frog saw an Ox and said to his mother, "He is so big!" The mother Frog tried to puff herself up to look like the Ox. "Was he this big?" she asked. The little Frog said, "No, even bigger!" She puffed more and more, trying to match the Ox size. Finally, she puffed too much and burst. Trying to be someone you are not can hurt you. It is better to stay true to your own size and self.
