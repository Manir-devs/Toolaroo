A Lion was sleeping in the forest when a tiny Mouse ran over his paw. The Lion woke up and caught the Mouse. The Mouse said, "Please let me go. I may help you one day." The Lion laughed but let him go. Later, the Lion was caught in a net by hunters. He roared loudly. The Mouse heard him, came quickly, and chewed the ropes. The Lion was free and thankful. Even small creatures can do big things when it really matters.
