A Dog was walking home with a big bone in his mouth. While crossing a bridge, he looked into the water and saw his own reflection. He thought it was another dog with a bigger bone. Wanting both bones, he opened his mouth to bark. His bone fell into the water and was lost. Now he had nothing. If he had been happy with what he had, he would still have the bone. Greed can make you lose everything.
