A Shepherd Boy watched sheep near a village. One day, he got bored and shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" The villagers came running, but there was no wolf. He laughed at them. He did it again the next day, and people stopped trusting him. Then one day, a real wolf came. The boy shouted loudly, but no one believed him. The wolf attacked the sheep, and the boy lost them all. No one helps a liar, even when he tells the truth later.
