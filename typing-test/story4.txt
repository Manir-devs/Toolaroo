A hungry Fox saw a bunch of grapes hanging high on a vine. He wanted to eat them and jumped to reach them, but they were too high. He jumped again and again but failed each time. Tired and angry, the Fox gave up. As he walked away, he said, "Those grapes are probably sour anyway." He did not want to admit he could not reach them. Instead of feeling sad, he pretended not to care. It is easy to say something is bad when we cannot get it.
