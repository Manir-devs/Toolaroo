All summer long, the Ant worked hard collecting food. Nearby, the Grasshopper danced and sang, not caring about winter. When cold days came, the Ant stayed warm with plenty of food. The Grasshopper was cold and hungry. He asked the Ant for food, but the Ant said, "You should have worked in summer." The Grasshopper felt sorry. He understood that fun is good, but hard work is needed to be safe during hard times. He promised to work next year.
