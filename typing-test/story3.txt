A Hare always teased a Tortoise for being slow. The Tortoise finally said, "Let us have a race." The Hare agreed and ran quickly. Soon, he got tired and took a nap, thinking he would win anyway. But the Tortoise kept walking without stopping. When the Hare woke up, the Tortoise was near the finish line. The Hare ran fast but was too late. The slow Tortoise won the race by not giving up. Going steady is better than being too proud.
