A Town Mouse visited his cousin, the Country Mouse. In the village, the food was simple and life was quiet. The Town Mouse said, "Come to the city. We eat delicious food." The Country Mouse went with him. But in the city, they were always hiding from people and loud noises. The Country Mouse got scared and said, "I prefer my quiet home with little food instead of fear with rich food." He returned home, happy with his peaceful life.
